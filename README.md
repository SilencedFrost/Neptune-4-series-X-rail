## Introduction

The design allows you to put a front mounted MGN12H linear rail on the neptune 4 series, currently it's in beta and highly experimental.

Earliest testing data yielded a 20% increase in recommended accel via input shaping(IS), with a reduction in vibrations and corner smoothing using nozzle adxl.

### Features
- Improved COM placement.
- Increased rigidity.
- Proper parallel belt path.
- Increase movement accuracy, toolhead rigidity.
- Lowers the gantry compared to toolhead -> z cable bracket no longer hitting tie rods.
- Retains most mod compatibility (cable chains, fan mods, etc).
### Cons:
- 8mm loss in Y axis compared to stock.
- Renders the aux fan null.
- Requires skill, hardware, and machine tuning.

### Drilling the extrusion

Run at high rpm and feed the drillbit in slowly, or else it'll bite on the aluminum and you'll have a bad time! Hold the extrusion down tight.

There's no need to drill deeper than the first top flange.
