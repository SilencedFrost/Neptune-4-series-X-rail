## Introduction

The design allows you to put a front mounted MGN12H linear rail on the neptune 4 series, currently it's in beta and highly experimental

Earliest testing data yielded a 20% increase in recommended accel via input shaping(IS), with a reduction in vibrations and corner smoothing

### Features
- Improved COM placement
- Increased rigidity
- Proper parallel belt path
- Increase movement accuracy, toolhead rigidity
- Lowers the gantry compared to toolhead -> z cable bracket no longer hitting tie rods
- Retains most mod compatibility (cable chains, fan mods, etc)
### Cons:
- 8mm loss in Y axis compared to stock
- Renders the aux fan null
- Requires skill, hardware, and machine tuning
